# ShowBuff Mobile App Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Adding Movies to Lists Not Working
**Problem**: Users were unable to add movies to their lists (watchlist, currently-watching, watched).

**Root Cause**: 
- In the server's `/api/user/add-to-list` route, there was a call to a non-existent function `getUser(req.userId)` instead of the correct `getUserById(req.userId)` function.
- The `activities` Map was referenced but not properly defined or imported in the server code.

**Fix**:
- Changed `getUser(req.userId)` to `getUserById(req.userId)` in the add-to-list route
- Added the `activities` Map to the data.js file and properly exported it
- Updated the import statement in index.js to include the activities Map

### 2. Empty Profile Page
**Problem**: The profile page was empty, showing no data.

**Root Cause**:
- The same issues affecting the add-to-list functionality were also affecting the profile page.
- The `move-to-list` route also had the same `getUser` function issue.
- Without proper activity tracking, the profile page couldn't display user activities.

**Fix**:
- Fixed the `getUser(req.userId)` call in the move-to-list route to use `getUserById(req.userId)`
- Ensured the activities Map was properly defined and imported
- These fixes allow the server to properly track and return user activities and list data

## Testing Verification

We verified the fixes by:
1. Starting the backend server on port 3001
2. Creating a test user account
3. Successfully adding a movie to the user's watchlist
4. Successfully moving the movie from watchlist to currently-watching
5. Confirming the lists were properly updated

## Additional Notes

- The server now properly tracks user activities when adding or moving movies between lists
- The profile page should now display the user's movie lists and activities correctly
- These fixes ensure that the core functionality of adding movies to lists and viewing them on the profile page works as expected

## Next Steps

1. Test the mobile app with these server fixes to ensure end-to-end functionality
2. Monitor for any additional issues that may arise
3. Consider adding more robust error handling and logging to prevent similar issues in the future
